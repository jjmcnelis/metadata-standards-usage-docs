# BCO-DMO: Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office [](https://www.bco-dmo.org/)

>The metadata database was initially created in 2007 and has evolved over time as our understanding of our needs became clearer.  We knew that the metadata database should support our user and data needs.  We tried, at first, to use a metadata standard but found them to be either overly complex or not sufficient for our needs.  Eventually, we realized that we could support any well designed standard by mapping our metadata database entries to the standard, and indeed we have already done this for the ISO19115-2 metadata standards. 

## notes

* BCO-DMO developed its metadata database to meet the needs of users and re-distributors.
* It implements translations from the metadata fields that it collects in its database into the metadata standards that are being adopted by users.
* **Data delivered to users are bundled with the corresponding metadata formatted according to [ISO 19115-2]().
