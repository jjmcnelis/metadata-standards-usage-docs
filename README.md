# notes about file metadata standards




### Darwin Core

>Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the Darwin Core maintenance group. It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

### KNB: Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity

* exposes metadata through APIs maintained by DataONE affiliates.

**supported standards/specifications:**

* EML

As part of the KNB effort, data management software is developed in a free and open source manner, so other groups can build upon the tools. The KNB is powered by the Metacat data management system, and is optimized for handling data sets described using the Ecological Metadata Language, but can store any XML-based metadata document.

## impressions

* EDI data handlers don't do themselves any favors if they receive metadata from data providers in word documents...
